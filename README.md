NOISE(WIP)

The concept for Noise focuses on an adaptation of existing stories or more accurately a removal of narrative techniques from news articles. News articles, video, interviews are employed to help add some coherence to world events. Noise takes this well used format and attempts to remove it, by taking information curated by news outlets and adding back in the chaotic nature that they are sculpted from. The initial concept for Noise focused around the idea of a 3D space created with the use of three.js to help facilitate an artistic deconstruction of coherent stories. It would employ other narrative techniques, such as audio to help convey the chaotic nature of most news stories. How information is collated and delivered in a more streamlined way. Helping viewers to digest news articles without feeling overwhelmed. There has been a recent shift in how digital technologies influence modern news delivery, with online content using more interactive forms of delivery. This shift doesnâ€™t necessarily add any chaos back into each story but does show a shift in narrative techniques. I was keen to explore this shift in delivery methods during this project, but with a greater focus on removing a lot of narrative techniques along the way.
